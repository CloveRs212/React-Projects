# React-Projects

Hey Guys! This Repo is a collection of just some Basic React Projects that I first made to learn basics and master somethings about React.
It was a blast making this list of projects, they are all basic projects that later on can inspire to be impemented inside one of our apps we will make.
Feel free to check it out and eventually we will be using this repo as a foundation for future courses around React! AS we are aiming to create interactive
course for everyone to use in order to learn much faster! Now let me give details on things that were learned from these projects.

1. Custom hooks and how to set up organized system
2. Creating links inside of react to link pages together in one
3. Css styling using classnames like you would with a framework like Tailwind
